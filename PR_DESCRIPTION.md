# 🐔📧 Farm-Based Email System Implementation

## Overview
This PR implements a **farm-based email system** that sends consolidated daily task reminders per farm instead of per house. This provides a more organized and efficient way for workers to receive their daily tasks.

## 🎯 **Key Changes**

### **Backend Changes**
- **Enhanced API Endpoint**: `POST /api/tasks/send-daily-tasks/` now supports optional `farm_id` parameter
- **New Email Service Method**: `TaskEmailService.send_farm_task_reminders(farm)` for farm-specific sending
- **Updated Management Command**: Support for farm-specific email sending via `--farm-id` parameter
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better error messages and status reporting

### **Frontend Changes**
- **EmailManager Component**: New component for farm-specific email management
- **EmailStatus Component**: Navigation bar email status indicator with quick actions
- **Context-Aware UI**: Different button text and descriptions based on farm context
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Better organization and clearer email management

### **Documentation**
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed guides for farm-based email system
- **API Documentation**: Updated endpoint documentation
- **Usage Examples**: Clear examples for different use cases

## 🚀 **Features**

### **1. Farm-Based Email Sending**
- **One Email Per Farm**: Workers receive one email containing all tasks for all houses in their farm
- **Consolidated Tasks**: All house tasks organized in a single, well-structured email
- **Farm Context**: Clear identification of which farm the tasks belong to

### **2. Flexible Email Management**
- **Global Sending**: Send emails to all active farms (Dashboard)
- **Farm-Specific Sending**: Send emails to specific farms (Farm Detail, House Detail)
- **Test Email Support**: Send test emails to verify configuration
- **Email History**: View previously sent emails and their status

### **3. Enhanced User Interface**
- **Dashboard**: Global email management with "Send All Farm Tasks" button
- **Farm Detail**: Farm-specific email management with "Send Farm Tasks" button
- **House Detail**: Inherits farm context with "Send Farm Tasks" button
- **Navigation**: Email status indicator with quick send options

## 📧 **Email Structure**

### **Before (House-Based)**
```
📧 Daily Tasks - House 1
📧 Daily Tasks - House 2
📧 Daily Tasks - House 3
```

### **After (Farm-Based)**
```
📧 Daily Task Reminder - Main Farm
├── House 1 Tasks
├── House 2 Tasks
└── House 3 Tasks
```

## 🔧 **API Changes**

### **New Endpoint Support**
```http
POST /api/tasks/send-daily-tasks/
Content-Type: application/json

# Send to all farms
{}

# Send to specific farm
{"farm_id": 1}
```

### **Management Command**
```bash
# Send to all farms
python manage.py send_daily_tasks

# Send to specific farm
python manage.py send_daily_tasks --farm-id 1

# Test email for specific farm
python manage.py send_daily_tasks --test --farm-id 1 --test-email user@example.com
```

## 📱 **UI Components**

### **EmailManager Component**
- **Props**: `farmId?`, `farmName?`
- **Features**: Send daily tasks, test emails, view history
- **Context**: Global or farm-specific based on props

### **EmailStatus Component**
