# ðŸ”§ Seeding Fix Summary

## Issue
The test email endpoint was returning `{"error":"Farm not found"}` when using `farm_id=1`, even though farms were created successfully.

## Root Cause
When using the `--clear` option in the seeding script, Django deleted all records but didn't reset the auto-increment sequences for the primary keys. This meant:

- **Before Fix**: Farms had IDs 3, 4, 5... (continuing from previous data)
- **User Expected**: Farms with IDs 1, 2, 3... (starting from 1)

## Solution
Updated the seeding script to reset SQLite auto-increment sequences after clearing data:

```python
# Reset auto-increment sequences
from django.db import connection
with connection.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("DELETE FROM sqlite_sequence WHERE name IN ('farms_farm', 'farms_worker', 'houses_house', 'tasks_task', 'tasks_recurringtask', 'tasks_emailtask')")
```

## Test Results

### Before Fix
```bash
# Farms created with IDs 3, 4
Farms: [{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sunny Acres Farm'}, {'id': 4, 'name': 'Green Valley Poultry #2'}]

# Test email with farm_id=1 failed
curl ... --data-raw '{"farm_id":1,"test_email":"bobgel12@gmail.com"}'
# Response: {"error":"Farm not found"}
```

### After Fix
```bash
# Farms created with IDs 1, 2
Farms: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Sunny Acres Farm'}, {'id': 2, 'name': 'Green Valley Poultry #2'}]

# Test email with farm_id=1 works
curl ... --data-raw '{"farm_id":1,"test_email":"bobgel12@gmail.com"}'
# Response: {"message":"Test email sent successfully"}

# Test email with farm_id=2 also works
curl ... --data-raw '{"farm_id":2,"test_email":"bobgel12@gmail.com"}'
# Response: {"message":"Test email sent successfully"}
```

## Impact
- âœ… **Test emails now work** with expected farm IDs
- âœ… **Seeding script is more reliable** for development
- âœ… **Consistent ID numbering** across all tables
- âœ… **Better development experience** with predictable data

## Files Modified
- `backend/farms/management/commands/seed_data.py` - Added sequence reset logic

The seeding script now properly resets auto-increment sequences, ensuring that farm IDs start from 1 as expected! ðŸŽ‰âœ¨
